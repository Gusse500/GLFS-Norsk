        This was made in anticipation for a few updates to come out, making
	changes that might be seen as weird or controversial. This offers as
	a section to explain those changes. <xref linkend="changelog"/> doesn't
        provide a good format to explain why commits and changes are being made,
	but rather just what changes were made.
