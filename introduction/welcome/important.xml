  <title>Important Information</title>

  <para>
    BLFS has more information regarding compilation, /usr vs /usr/local,
    boot scripts, etc. at 
    <ulink url="&blfs-svn;/introduction/important.html"/>.
    Unlike this book, this would be a chapter in BLFS.
    A lot of that information has been omitted as this book is more linear
    and doesn't follow how BLFS follows. However, we will cover some bases
    here.
  </para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Stability</title>

    <para>
      This book is in a constant flux of updates, including packages and can
      be akin to the BLFS Git version. Right now, there is no stable
      version of GLFS. This may cause problems when you wish to continue onto
      BLFS. Sometimes, packages in this book will have newer versions than even
      BLFS development pages. It is recommended to remember what versions of
      packages you have on your system because of this. Expect build failures
      at some point, although we try to limit that possibility.
    </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Init System</title>

    <para>
      This book doesn't have instructions for Systemd. It is meant for SysV
      LFS systems, but if you find or make your own bootscripts, you can
      use the instructions in this book on a system that has Runit or
      OpenRC. Systemd will take more work and the process involves checking
      <ulink url="https://&lfs-domainname;/blfs/view/systemd"/> and compare the
      instructions for each package. There aren't many packages that require
      this process except ones that may need to be started as a service.
      The <quote>Security</quote> subsection of the Shared Dependencies chapter
      is especially different so watch out for it if you are using Systemd. The
      reason for not using Systemd is that it makes things more complicated,
      a lot of users use more simplistic init systems like SysVinit for their
      LFS system, and including instructions for both can result in two book
      versions which would be rather inconvenient.
    </para>

    <title>Building software</title>

    <para>
      Building software on GLFS is identical to how it's done in the
      BLFS books, along with having lib32 compilation instructions. It
      goes without saying firstmost that you should have <envar>MAKEFLAGS</envar>
      set to save yourself a lot of time. This is useful for the <command>make
      </command> utility to use the amount of threads that you both want
      and have.
    </para>

<screen><userinput>export MAKEFLAGS='-jx'</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      Replace <option>x</option> with the amount of threads you have.
      You can check the amount of threads you have with:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>grep processor /proc/cpuinfo</userinput></screen>

    <important>
      <para>
        Make sure that you have enough RAM for your system!
        A general method is having 2.5G per thread that is thrown at
        <command>make</command>. For instance, if you want to use 6 threads,
        multiply 6 by 2.5 (which is 15), then make sure you have 15G of RAM.
        If you don't have that RAM, try and limit the threads you throw at
        <command>make</command>.
      </para>
    </important>

    <para>
      Next is compiling for 32-bit. There are many packages which will have
      a lib32 counterpart. If you just got done with a normal compilation
      of a package and wish to do a 32-bit compilation of that same package,
      make sure to clean the directory first:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>make distclean</userinput></screen>

    <para>Or, if you made a build directory, do this in the build
    directory:</para>

    <screen><userinput>rm -rf *</userinput></screen>

    <para>Then proceed with the 32-bit compilation instructions.</para>

    <para>
      Generally, the format of targetting 32-bit goes like this:
    </para>

    <para>For <command>./configure</command>:</para>

<screen><userinput>CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32"                  \
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib32/pkgconfig          \
./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib32 \
            --host=i686-pc-linux-gnu &amp;&amp;

make &amp;&amp;

make DESTDIR=$PWD/DESTDIR install     &amp;&amp;
cp -vr DESTDIR/usr/lib32/* /usr/lib32 &amp;&amp;
rm -rf DESTDIR                        &amp;&amp;
ldconfig</userinput></screen>

    <para>For <command>meson</command>:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -v build &amp;&amp;
cd       build &amp;&amp;

CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32"                     \
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib32/pkgconfig             \
meson setup .. --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib32 &amp;&amp;

ninja &amp;&amp;

DESTDIR=$PWD/DESTDIR ninja install    &amp;&amp;
cp -vr DESTDIR/usr/lib32/* /usr/lib32 &amp;&amp;
rm -rf DESTDIR                        &amp;&amp;
ldconfig</userinput></screen>

    <para>For <command>cmake</command>:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -v build &amp;&amp;
cd       build &amp;&amp;

CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32"           \
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/lib32/pkgconfig" \
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr   \
         -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib32 &amp;&amp;

make &amp;&amp;

make DESTDIR=$PWD/DESTDIR install     &amp;&amp;
cp -vr DESTDIR/usr/lib32/* /usr/lib32 &amp;&amp;
rm -rf DESTDIR                        &amp;&amp;
ldconfig</userinput></screen>

    <note>
      <para>
        After you do a DESTDIR installation, it is recommended to
        to use <command>file</command> on one of the libraries in
        <filename>DESTDIR/usr/lib32</filename>. An output of such
        a command for a 32-bit build of a library should be
        comparable to the following:
      </para>

<screen><computeroutput>ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked</computeroutput></screen>

      <para>
        Note the <computeroutput>32-bit LSB shared object</computeroutput> part.
        A 64-bit library would show as a <computeroutput>64-bit LSB shared
        object</computeroutput>.
      </para>
