  <title>Meson Native Toolchain File</title>

  <para>
    Most applications that rely on the <application>Meson</application>
    build system have decent support for cross compilation, ie. compiling
    32-bit binaries on a 64-bit system. It can be as easy as setting the
    <envar>CC</envar>, <envar>CXX</envar>, and <envar>PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    </envar> variables before using the <userinput>meson setup ..
    </userinput> command to compile 32-bit binaries on a 64-bit system.
    However, some projects are more complicated for many different
    reasons, leading to the necessity of a <application>Meson
    </application> native toolchain file. It specifies the compilers,
    options that should be invoked, the <application>pkg-conf</application>
    binary (or rather symlink that uses a certain personality file) to use,
    <command>llvm-config</command> to use, etc. This isn't required for
    <xref linkend="steam"/> unless you want to install Mesa's NVK driver,
    which isn't in the book at the moment. It is needed for Gstreamer which
    is a recommended dependency of <xref linkend="wine"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
    There exists another type of <application>Meson</application> file
    called a cross toolchain file. However, it equates to pretending
    that cross compilation is happening, leading to build failures.
    Native toolchain files are the solution to this.
