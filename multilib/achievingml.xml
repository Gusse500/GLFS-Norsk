  <title>Achieving Multilib</title>

  <para>
    On many distros, getting multilib support is very straight
    forward. There exists a guide that can act as a replacement
    for LFS: compiling and configuring a system that can boot,
    run, and compile software; and also have that same ability
    with 32-bit. It acts to form the basis that will allow you
    to follow any of the instructions laid out in the Steam
    and Wine chapters.
  </para>

  <para>
    Such a guide is maintained by Thomas Trepl at
    <ulink url="https://www.&lfs-domainname;/~thomas/multilib-m32/"/>.
    This only covers installing 32-bit support along with 64-bit. If you
    want x32-bit support, which is not needed for this book, follow
    <ulink url="https://www.&lfs-domainname;/~thomas/multilib/"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
    The same principles of compiling for 32-bit in that book will also
    apply to this book as well. If you haven't already, read
    <xref linkend="important"/>
    to check what basic principles still apply in this book when targeting
    32-bit.

    Furthermore, read <xref linkend="which-instructions"/> to find out which
    instructions to follow.
