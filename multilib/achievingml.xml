  <title>Achieving Multilib</title>

  <para>
    On many distros, getting multilib support is very straight
    forward. There exists a guide that can act as a replacement
    for LFS: compiling and configuring a system that can boot,
    run, and compile software; and also have that same ability
    with 32-bit. It acts to form the basis that will allow you
    to follow any of the instructions laid out in the Steam
    and Wine chapters.
  </para>

  <para>
    Such a guide is maintained by Thomas Trepl at
    <ulink url="&mlfs-m32-root;"/>.
    This only covers installing 32-bit support along with 64-bit. If you
    want x32-bit support, which is not needed for this book, follow
    <ulink url="&mlfs-root;"/>.

  <sect2 revision="systemd">
    <title>Rendering MLFS</title>

    <para>
      First, install <xref linkend="git"/>, then clone the LFS repo and switch
      to the <computeroutput>multilib</computeroutput> branch:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>git clone https://git.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs.git mlfs &amp;&amp;
cd mlfs &amp;&amp;
git checkout multilib</userinput></screen>

    &multilib-rendering2;

    <para>
      Now inspect the <filename>INSTALL</filename> file to check for the needed
      dependencies in order to render the book. Once you have ensured you have
      installed everything, render the book:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>make -j1 REV=systemd ARCH=ml_32</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      This will render the book in
      <filename class="directory">~/public_html/lfs-systemd</filename>.
      You can change how much multilib support you wish to render the book
      with by changing the <envar>ARCH</envar> variable's value.
      The above command will render 64-bit and 32-bit support but leaves out
      x32-bit support, which is not needed for this book. If you want to get
      that support too, change <computeroutput>ARCH=ml_32</computeroutput> to
      <computeroutput>ARCH=ml_all</computeroutput>.
      You can then point to the HTML using a browser like
      <ulink url="&blfs-svn;/xsoft/firefox.html">Firefox</ulink> or
      <ulink url="&blfs-svn;/basicnet/lynx.html">Lynx</ulink>.
    </para>

    <para>
      For <application>Firefox</application>, type in the search bar:

<computeroutput>file:///home/<replaceable>&lt;username&gt;</replaceable>/public_html/lfs-systemd/index.html</computeroutput>,

      and replace <replaceable>&lt;username&gt;</replaceable>
      with the name of the username you rendered the book with.
    </para>

     <para>
       For <application>Lynx</application>, run the following:
     </para>

<screen><userinput>lynx ~/public_html/lfs-systemd/index.html</userinput></screen>

  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>More Info</title>

    <para>
      The same principles of compiling for 32-bit in that book will also
      apply to this book as well. If you haven't already, read
      <xref linkend="important"/>
      to check what basic principles still apply in this book when targeting
      32-bit.
    </para>

    <para>
      Furthermore, read <xref linkend="which-instructions"/> to find out which
      instructions to follow.
