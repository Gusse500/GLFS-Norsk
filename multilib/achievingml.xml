  <title>Achieving Multilib</title>

  <para>
    On many distros, getting multilib support is very straight
    forward. There exists a guide that can act as a replacement
    for LFS: compiling and configuring a system that can boot,
    run, and compile software; and also have that same ability
    with 32-bit. It acts to form the basis that will allow you
    to follow any of the instructions laid out in the Steam
    and Wine chapters.

  <para>
    Such a guide is maintained by Thomas Trepl at
    <ulink url="https://www.&lfs-domainname;/~thomas/multilib/"/>.
    It is very comprehensive and also covers how to get x32-bit
    support, a format that can run 64-bit code with 32-bit registers.
    That format is unnecessary. Most applications that are covered here
    either don't: support it, require it, or is simply not necessary
    to compile for any sort of interest. Therefore, any mention
    of x32-bit, x32, mx32, and x32-bit instructions can be skipped.
    Most users will not need it and the extra support in compilers
    and libraries on the system will be useless, taking up disk space.

    The same principles of compiling for 32-bit in that book will also
    apply to this book as well. If you haven't already, read
    <xref linkend="important"/>
    to check what basic principles still apply in this book when targeting
    32-bit.
