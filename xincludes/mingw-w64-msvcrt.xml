    <para>
      <parameter>--with-default-msvcrt=msvcrt</parameter>: As of
      <application>MinGW-w64-12.0.0</application>, the Universal C Runtime
      (UCRT), added in Windows 10, has become the default. This option
      makes the Microsoft Visual C Runtime (MSVCRT) the default, which is more
      tested and has less bugs. It also ensures compatibility with software
      made for older Windows versions.
