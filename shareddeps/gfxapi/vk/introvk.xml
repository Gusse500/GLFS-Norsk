  <title>Intro to Vulkan</title>

  <sect2>
    <title>What is Vulkan</title>

    <para>
      Vulkan is a low-level graphics API meant to solve the issues of
      OpenGL, often relating to performance.
    </para>

    <para>
      When applications written with Vulkan in mind are well optimized,
      they often perform better than applications written in OpenGL. Most
      Windows games are written in Direct3D on the otherhand. DXVK, which is
      part of <application>Steam</application>'s Proton and
      <application>Wine</application>, converts Direct3D instructions
      to Vulkan calls and has very little overhead. It performs almost
      as good as on Windows, whereas converting the Direct3D instructions
      to OpenGL calls has much more overhead.

    <title>What do I need to install?</title>

    <para>
      Unlike OpenGL where it had two options to get the libraries
      and possibly cause confusion and extra thought, the Vulkan
      library is supplied directly from KhronosGroup.
      <xref linkend="vkheaders"/> must be installed before
      <xref linkend="libvk"/>. While this is the baseline for what is
      needed to get Vulkan working, some applications require more software
      in relation to Vulkan: <xref linkend="spirv-headers"/>,
      <xref linkend="spirv-tools"/>, and <xref linkend="glslang"/>.
      They are necessary to compile Vulkan shaders into bytecode which Vulkan
      as an API can process, unlike OpenGL where shader code is written
      as a string, OpenGL compiles it into a binary, then runs it every frame.
      Using bytecode for OpenGL is possible, however, and requires extra setup.
