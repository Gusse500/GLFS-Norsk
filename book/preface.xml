  <title>Preface</title>

  <para>
    After around 2 or 3 months of my first ever install of Linux From Scratch,
    I had an question: how do I install <application>Steam</application> on
    this? After some time, I went for Beyond Linux From Scratch, a very great
    book that covered most of what I both wanted and needed, but my
    <application>Steam</application> question never got answered. So I just
    tried to install the <application>Steam</application> tarball and I went
    down the rabbit hole.
  </para>

  <para>
    Beyond Linux From Scratch didn't show how so I felt alone and on my own.
    I learned shortly after my attempt that I need multilib, and Bruce Dubbs
    saw my email and responded quite promptly saying to go to Thomas' Multilib
    mirror. This made all the difference, but now I needed to find out all the
    packages to install, all the configuration.
  </para>

  <para>
    Rahul Chandra in the same thread mentioned his scripts for his distro,
    Tucana. These scripts helped so much, even if all the scripts were
    presented all at once. Once I had got <application>Steam</application>
    to work, I realized that in some way, somehow, I must share how I did it
    and to help others with a single comprehensive guide.
  </para>

  <para>
    At some point, I also decided to try to get Wine to work. I was successful.
    I, again like with <application>Steam</application> before, wanted to share
    the process. Rahul reached out to me, and that led to this book's creation
    and editing.
  </para>

  <para>
    Thank you, and I hope this helps you.
