  <title>Foreword</title>

  <para>
    This book is separate from LFS and BLFS, where it should be followed after
    LFS but before BLFS. On x86_64 systems, this book is meant to be followed
    after Thomas' Multilib mirror of LFS.
  </para>

  <para>
    This book is also meant specifically for LFS systems not using Systemd.
    It uses SysV bootscripts but if you get bootscripts meant for another init
    system, or make your own, then the instructions will work just as well.
