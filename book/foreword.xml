  <title>Foreword</title>

  <para>
    This version of the book is meant to be a separate book from LFS
    and BLFS entirely but meant to be used in conjuction with BLFS.
    This is meant to be built on Thomas' Multilib mirror with
    modifications.
  </para>

  <para>
    This book is also meant specifically for LFS systems not using Systemd.
    It uses SysV bootscripts but if you get bootscripts meant for another init
    system, or make your own, then the instructions will work just as well.
