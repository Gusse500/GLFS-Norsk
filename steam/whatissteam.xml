  <title>What is Steam?</title>

  <para>
    Steam is an application that can execute a variety of games
    and even software, which can even execute Windows applications
    without the need of Wine via the Steam tool Proton. This can
    can be a replacement for Wine although some applications might
    not work as expected. Most games are built for Windows but
    most work just fine via Proton and Proton works both on regular
    Linux distributions, including LFS without all the setup required
    for Wine.

  <para>
    As Steam is a gaming application, it depends on many tools,
    libraries, and graphics APIs to function and perform as it should.
    Obvious among such software would be OpenGL, Vulkan, and graphics
    drivers. Less obvious software includes audio and a window manager
    or desktop environment.

    Please check the Steam dependency list to find what you will need
    before proceeding, although most of this chapter is a straight shot.
    There is some choice involved such as choosing if you want X11 or
    Wayland, Pulseaudio or Pipewire, so forth. There are subsections to
    help readability and also meant to serve those following the Wine
    chapter.
