  <title>Troubleshooting Steam</title>

  <para>
    It is recommended to just install the GLFS version of
    <xref linkend="glibc"/> if on x86_64 instead of following this troubleshooting
    mini-guide. It is best practice now, and this guide down the line may
    become irrelevant, making <xref linkend="glibc"/> an upmost requirement.
    If you absolutely do not want to recompile glibc with the 
    <command>"-mstackrealign"</command> flag, and have not done so already,
    you may follow this mini-guide instead. None of this section is necessary
    if you already installed glibc with <command>"-mstackrealign"</command>.
    You should not encounter any Steam issues out of the ordinary.

    <title>Launch Options</title>

    <para>
      Any game or app, native or not, will fail to launch for an unknown reason.
      It will attempt to launch, and by the time a window should be created, Steam
      will fail and shut down the process. This can be resolved by going into the
      game or app's launch options and set the following:
    </para>

    <screen><userinput>LD_PRELOAD="" %command%</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      The game or app should now proceed to launch just fine, although the
      Steam overlay will not work.
    </para>

    <para>
      If the Steam overlay is desired instead, enter the following launch
      option instead:
    </para>

    <screen><userinput>LD_PRELOAD="$HOME/.local/share/Steam/ubuntu12_64/gameoverlayrenderer.so" %command%</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      This launch option loads a library necessary for the steam overlay to function.
    </para>
